        <h1 class="mt-4" id="Project-overview"><strong>Black  Women Organising</strong></h1><br>
          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of black womens contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britian.</h3>
        <p>This project is led by three Leeds Uni history students keen to promote the contributions of black women to British history and particularly the pursuit of social change. 
          We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglecting area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of black women's contributions even more critical. Unfortunately, given the neglect of this history there are limited sources available about many pioneering black women. This presented even more of a challenge to our project given we completed it during C19 and couldn't access in person archives. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create an inaccurate and reductive picture. 
          Basically we intend to show the breadth of black British women's active contribution to change in the country. We hope to illuminate through the time period covered that this is not a new phenomenon. The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. The foundations of our society are largely seen in this period and this is emphasised through our education system. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how black women contributed to the breadth of this period. 
          While there is an increasing visibility of black women in the British political and campaigning sphere, our research shows that this is still insufficient in public consciousness.</p>

          <p>In the 21st century there is far greater representation of Black Britons in the political mainstream. There is however still much progress to be made; racism directed at Black people in the political sphere persists and representation in the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the top levels of public bodies is far below what would be proportional to the population of the UK.</p>
          <p>Firstly, and frustratingly, data on race within parliament is collected and reported in a binary ‘white’/ ‘nonwhite’, so accurate data on the number of Black Britons in parliament is not readily available. Since 1987, there has been an increase in ‘Black and Ethnic Minority’ MPs at every election. The 2019 election saw 65 Black and Minority Ethnic MPs elected, 10% of the total seats in the house. That the ONS predict that 14.4% of the population of the UK is from a Ethnic Minority background in 2019 shows there is still a long way to go in achieving representative diversity. Notably there are currently no Black or Minority Ethnic MPs representing a Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish constituency, and there is a significant discrepancy between the diversity of the major parties: 6% of Conservative MPs are Black or Minority Ethnicities, compared to 20% in the Labour party and 18% in the Lib Dems. 56.9% of the MPs from Ethnic Minority backgrounds are women as of the 2019 election, a total of 37 MPs. Only 6.3% of the House of Lords are Ethnic Minorities. Black and Minority Ethnicity representation at the local government level is far behind the national. Within the Public Sector, there are high levels of Black and Minority Ethnic staff, but “in the majority of cases where data is available, ethnic minority representation is often lower in the higher pay grades.”</p> 
          <p>Whilst there are signs of progress in the position of Black Britons in politics in statistical terms, racist attitudes are still prevalent in British society. In a 2021 YouGov Survey, ‘Unequal Britain: attitudes to inequalities aftter COVID-19’, 47% of respondents believed that black people are more likely to be unemployed due to discrimination. However, 13% of the 2000 participants claimed that these inequalities are the result of black people lacking “motivation or willpower” and 4% claim Black people have “less in-born ability to learn,” reflecting a concerning, discriminatory and baseless view. There is however, some evidence from the study that the younger generation is less racist. There is clear evidence that Black and Minority Ethnic MPs face racism within the public sphere, from the media, state infrastructure, and the public. Research by ITV has found that 62% have faced ‘racism or racial profiling’ whilst on the Parliamentary estate in London, and 51% said this  had come from fellow MPs. A year after this report it is unclear what the House of Commons is doing to address this discriminatory culture at the heart of our democracy. </p><br>

          </a>Yvonne Field grew up in Deptford, South London, with her Jamaican parents and 9 siblings. Yvonne talks about the experience of being refused a place at Grammar School aged 11. Of the six applicants, the 5 white girls were accepted and she was the only applicant rejected. Yvonne’s mother and the local black community appealed this decision and won against the local education authority. Yvonne states that this experience committed her to racial justice campaigning, and taught her, “how you can and should try to intervene into systems when you experience discrimination.” Notably in 2014 Yvonne founded, and remains the CEO of, the Ubele Initiative. The Ubele Initiative is a social enterprise which is a bottom up, African- diaspora led, community focused organisation. The Ubele Initiative is committed to addressing the “deep social issues [which] continue to affect our community.” This is done through regional, local and national programmes, international diaspora networking, policy development and campaigning.</p>

               </a>The vision is to create a community wide strategy for ensuring the needs of the African diaspora in the UK are met, and future generations are empowered through knowledge sharing and resilience programmes to build a strong future. Yvonne is particularly driven by the needs of the increasing number of African diaspora elders and how these should be met.  In 2020, the Ubele Initiative was appointed by the Greater London Authority as the core regional BAME infrastructure organisation. In the COVID-19 pandemic Ubele have led research into the disproportionate impact of the crisis on charities specific to BAME communities, the necessity of these organisations and the lack of support they’ve received. </p>

          </a>Oona King was the second Black woman to be elected to the house of commons, in 1997. Oona was born in Sheffield,  grew up in Camden, North London, in a Jewish African- American family. Oona discusses being one of very few mixed-race children in her school growing up, and how she “had no role models,” and most of her childhood was brought up by her white Jewish mother. Oona was “parachuted in” to run for the constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow, which she won in 1997. Oona lost her seat in 2005 to George Galloway which concluded an unpleasant electoral campaign. There were tensions relating to Oona’s support for the Iraq war as the constituency had an almost 50% Muslim electorate. This position made her “increasingly unpopular” with her constituents. Oona discusses how her identity was weaponsied during the campaign, with rumours that she intended to ban halal meat, and was funded by Mossad, spreading. Oona believes anti-semitism, “was used really effectively during the campaign in a way that didn’t exactly shock me, because I’m aware of its existence, but in my life it had always been the black part of me that attracted the most prejudice. And suddenly it was the Jewish part.”</p>

Oona was appointed a life peer in 2011, as Baroness King of Bow and was Shadow Minister for Equalities in 2016. In 2016 Oona took a leave of absence from the Lords to become Global Diversity Director at YouTube, and is now Google's Director of Diversity Strategy.</p>

          </a>Dawn Butler is a Labour party MP who grew up in East London with her Jamaican parents. Before entering parliament she worked in the GMB trade union and as an advisor to the Mayor of London. Dawn was elected to represent the Brent South constituency in 2005 and became only the third black woman elected to the House of Commons. She was also during this time the first elected Black woman to sit in the British Cabinet, when she was made Minister of State for Youth Affairs in 2009. When in this role she became the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box in the House of Commons in December 2009: “the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history. I can’t remember his name, but one took great delight in telling me that ‘upskilling’ was not in the English dictionary. He knew it was a momentous time, but they’d all been instructed to put me down.” She lost her seat in 2010 and was re-elected as MP for Brent Central in 2015. Again she was quickly promoted to a senior position in the party, joining the shadow cabinet in 2016 in the new role of Shadow Minister for Diversity, then from 2017 Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, until she returned to the backbenches when Keir Starmer became leader in 2020. Dawn is a keen supporter of the BLM movement and launched the parliamentary black caucus in 2017 (although there is little information on this online). The first parliamentary black caucus in the UK was set up in 1988 by Bernie Grant, which disbanded in 1991.</p><br>

               </a>Dawn is outspoken on issues of injustice and has called for Creddisa Dick to resign from the Met Police, and extensive stop and search powers to be revoked. Dawn has also highlighter personal experiences of injustice at the hands of the police, accusing the Met of racial profiling in August 2020. Dawn also unfortunately faces horrific racist threats and violence, having had to close her constituency office after facing numerous death threats. She continues striving for change: “I made a commitment to myself, when I was elected to parliament, that I would ensure there would be other African-Caribbean women coming behind me. There’s no point in being the only one. It’s too much of a burden for one person to carry and we won’t see change.”</p>

          </a>Reni Eddo- Lodge is an anti-racism, feminist campaigner, writer and journalist. Notably Reni’s work, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, made Reni the first black author to top the UK bestseller list. Reni reached the number 1 spot in 2020 for her text which was published in 2017 and began with a blog post in 2014. The Nielsen Bookscan’s UK top 50 has been recording book sales in 2001. Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race topped the best seller list in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and the renewed awareness and participation in the Black Lives Matters movement in the summer of 2020. Reni comments on the challenges of this coupled with the fact that she is the first black author in the UK to reach this position:“Can’t help but be dismayed by this - the tragic circumstances in which this achievement came about… the fact that it’s 2020 and I’m the first.” Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race is a celebrated text, having won the Jhalak Prize for Book of the Year by a Writer of Colour in 2018, as one example. Reni is credited with promoting and articulating an intersectional approach to discrimination “into mainstream dialogue.” </p>

I’m happy to support in other ways.” Reni also has a podcast, ‘About Race with Reni Eddo-Lodge’ in which Reni and guests discuss the history and politics of race in the UK.

             Lavinya Stennett is the founder and CEO of the Black Curriculum, a social enterprise which since 2019 has been campaigning to address the lack of Black British history on the UK curriculum. The Black Curriculum is led by young people and designs teacher training and Black history programmes targeted at ages 8-16. One of the main intentions of the programme is to “equip young people with a sense of identity”. Lavinya reflects on her experience of the British education system growing up in South London and the impact of the Eurocentricity of the history programme, including on sense of belonging and representation in history. “I know it was a problem… but the language I have now, I didn’t have then. I didn’t feel part of that classroom environment and it wasn’t engaging at all.” Further the Black Curriculum was inspired by the absence of Black British history within even the Black History Month classes as these focused on slavery and US civil rights. During her degree in African studies and Development studies at SOAS Lavinya was taught a more broad, representative and deep history programme and designed the Black Curriculum in response. At SOAS, Lavinya was the University’s first Black Student Officer and won Activist of the Year in her final year.</p>

These are the things we call unconscious bias, but it’s very conscious in the curriculum. You don’t actually learn any black or African history. That is a conscious omission.”</strong></p>

             Temi Mwale is a social entrepreneur, educator, community activist and anti-racism campaigner. In 2018 she won the Groundwork’s young community leader of the year award for her work supporting and uplifting her community in Barnet. Notably she is the founder and executive director of the 4Front Project, established in 2012. 4Front is a youth led social enterprise that empowers communities and young people to live free from violence. “We support members with experiences of violence and the criminal justice system to create change; in their own lives, communities and society.” The 4Front projects model centres healing over punishment in response to violence, to build peace and justice, and understands that the experience of racial inequality, and the flaws of the criminal justice system in the UK, exacerbate violence. 4Front provides long term support and empowerment services for people aged 11-25 in prison, schools and communities to achieve this.</p>

               </a> Temi also uses her platform to dispel commonly held views about gang crime and hold the government and local authority to account on their response to this crisis, and failure to address the underlying roots: “when does the government take responsibility for the forms of violence that they inflict on others?” </p>
