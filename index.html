          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of black womens contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britian.</h3>
        <p>This project is led by three Leeds Uni history students keen to promote the contributions of black women to British history and particularly the pursuit of social change. 
          We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglecting area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of black women's contributions even more critical. Unfortunately, given the neglect of this history there are limited sources available about many pioneering black women. This presented even more of a challenge to our project given we completed it during C19 and couldn't access in person archives. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create an inaccurate and reductive picture. 
          Basically we intend to show the breadth of black British women's active contribution to change in the country. We hope to illuminate through the time period covered that this is not a new phenomenon. The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. The foundations of our society are largely seen in this period and this is emphasised through our education system. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how black women contributed to the breadth of this period. 
          While there is an increasing visibility of black women in the British political and campaigning sphere, our research shows that this is still insufficient in public consciousness.</p>

          <p>In the 21st century there is far greater representation of Black Britons in the political mainstream. There is however still much progress to be made; racism directed at Black people in the political sphere persists and representation in the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the top levels of public bodies is far below what would be proportional to the population of the UK.

Firstly, and frustratingly, data on race within parliament is collected and reported in a binary ‘white’/ ‘nonwhite’, so accurate data on the number of Black Britons in parliament is not readily available. Since 1987, there has been an increase in ‘Black and Ethnic Minority’ MPs at every election. The 2019 election saw 65 Black and Minority Ethnic MPs elected, 10% of the total seats in the house. That the ONS predict that 14.4% of the population of the UK is from a Ethnic Minority background in 2019 shows there is still a long way to go in achieving representative diversity. Notably there are currently no Black or Minority Ethnic MPs representing a Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish constituency, and there is a significant discrepancy between the diversity of the major parties: 6% of Conservative MPs are Black or Minority Ethnicities, compared to 20% in the Labour party and 18% in the Lib Dems. 56.9% of the MPs from Ethnic Minority backgrounds are women as of the 2019 election, a total of 37 MPs. Only 6.3% of the House of Lords are Ethnic Minorities. Black and Minority Ethnicity representation at the local government level is far behind the national. Within the Public Sector, there are high levels of Black and Minority Ethnic staff, but “in the majority of cases where data is available, ethnic minority representation is often lower in the higher pay grades.” 

Whilst there are signs of progress in the position of Black Britons in politics in statistical terms, racist attitudes are still prevalent in British society. In a 2021 YouGov Survey, ‘Unequal Britain: attitudes to inequalities aftter COVID-19’, 47% of respondents believed that black people are more likely to be unemployed due to discrimination. However, 13% of the 2000 participants claimed that these inequalities are the result of black people lacking “motivation or willpower” and 4% claim Black people have “less in-born ability to learn,” reflecting a concerning, discriminatory and baseless view. There is however, some evidence from the study that the younger generation is less racist. There is clear evidence that Black and Minority Ethnic MPs face racism within the public sphere, from the media, state infrastructure, and the public. Research by ITV has found that 62% have faced ‘racism or racial profiling’ whilst on the Parliamentary estate in London, and 51% said this  had come from fellow MPs. A year after this report it is unclear what the House of Commons is doing to address this discriminatory culture at the heart of our democracy.
