        <h1 class="mt-4" id="Project-overview"><strong>Black  Women Organising</strong></h1><br>
          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of black womens contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britian.</h3>
        <p>This project is led by three Leeds Uni history students keen to promote the contributions of black women to British history and particularly the pursuit of social change. 
          We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglecting area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of black women's contributions even more critical. Unfortunately, given the neglect of this history there are limited sources available about many pioneering black women. This presented even more of a challenge to our project given we completed it during C19 and couldn't access in person archives. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create an inaccurate and reductive picture. 
          Basically we intend to show the breadth of black British women's active contribution to change in the country. We hope to illuminate through the time period covered that this is not a new phenomenon. The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. The foundations of our society are largely seen in this period and this is emphasised through our education system. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how black women contributed to the breadth of this period. 
          While there is an increasing visibility of black women in the British political and campaigning sphere, our research shows that this is still insufficient in public consciousness.</p>

Olive was a member of the youth wing of the British Black Panther Movement, having joined in 1968, and got involved in campaigning for every and all issues: “she was never too busy to offer support.” Olive helped set up supplementary schools, squats and Black Bookshops. In 1974 Olive co-founded the instrumental Brixton Black Women’s Group.

              Unfortunately, throughout her public service Dianne has suffered horrifying levels of discrimination and abuse. Amnesty International found that in the 6 weeks before the 2017 General Election, Diane received 45% of all abusive tweets sent to all female MPs, illustrating the prevalence of misogynoir that riddles British public life.

          </a> Reni Eddo- Lodge is an anti-racism, feminist campaigner, writer and journalist. In 2020, Reni became the first black author to top the UK bestseller list with her 2017 text, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race. “Can’t help but be dismayed by this - the tragic circumstances in which this achievement came about… the fact that it’s 2020 and I’m the first.” The Nielsen Bookscan’s UK top 50 has been recording book sales in 2001, and the summer of 2020 saw the Black Lives Matter movement grow around the world in response to the murder of George Floyd.

            Lavinya Stennett is the founder and CEO of the Black Curriculum, a social enterprise founded in 2019. The Black Curriculum is led by young people and designs teacher training and Black history programmes targeted at ages 8-16. The Black Curriculum was inspired by the absence of Black British history within even the Black History Month classes during Lavinya’s upbringing in South London; these focused on slavery and US civil rights.

               </a> Lavinya designed the Black Curriculum in response to the far more inclusive, international history she was introduced to when studying African studies and Development studies at SOAS.

          <p>In the 21st century there is far greater representation of Black Britons in the political mainstream. However, racism directed at Black people in the political sphere persists and representation in the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the top levels of public bodies is far below what would be proportional to the population of the UK.</p>
          <p>Since 1987 there has been an increase in Black and Minority Ethnicity MPs elected in the UK at every election, with 65 elected in 2019. This is 10% of our parliament, which is not proportional to the 14.4% of our electorate that is Black or Minority Ethnic. Further, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/kzi666gg1s/KCL_Inequality1stRelease_201113.pdf">2021 YouGov Survey, ‘Unequal Britain: attitudes to inequalities after COVID-19’</a> demonstrates that a concerning level of racism remains in our society, and research conducted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/black-minority-ethnic-mps-racism-in-parliament-study">ITV in 2020</a> found that <strong>over 50% of Black and Minority Ethnicity MPs had experienced racial discrimination by another sitting member of parliament</strong>. There is a long way to go.</p>
