        <h1 class="mt-4" id="Project-overview"><strong>Black  Women Organising</strong></h1><br>
          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of black womens contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britian.</h3>
        <p>This project is led by three Leeds Uni history students keen to promote the contributions of black women to British history and particularly the pursuit of social change. 
          We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglecting area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of black women's contributions even more critical. Unfortunately, given the neglect of this history there are limited sources available about many pioneering black women. This presented even more of a challenge to our project given we completed it during C19 and couldn't access in person archives. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create an inaccurate and reductive picture. 
          Basically we intend to show the breadth of black British women's active contribution to change in the country. We hope to illuminate through the time period covered that this is not a new phenomenon. The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. The foundations of our society are largely seen in this period and this is emphasised through our education system. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how black women contributed to the breadth of this period. 
          While there is an increasing visibility of black women in the British political and campaigning sphere, our research shows that this is still insufficient in public consciousness.</p>

          <p>In the 21st century there is far greater representation of Black Britons in the political mainstream. There is however still much progress to be made; racism directed at Black people in the political sphere persists and representation in the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the top levels of public bodies is far below what would be proportional to the population of the UK.</p>
          <p>Firstly, and frustratingly, data on race within parliament is collected and reported in a binary ‘white’/ ‘nonwhite’, so accurate data on the number of Black Britons in parliament is not readily available. Since 1987, there has been an increase in ‘Black and Ethnic Minority’ MPs at every election. The 2019 election saw 65 Black and Minority Ethnic MPs elected, 10% of the total seats in the house. That the ONS predict that 14.4% of the population of the UK is from a Ethnic Minority background in 2019 shows there is still a long way to go in achieving representative diversity. Notably there are currently no Black or Minority Ethnic MPs representing a Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish constituency, and there is a significant discrepancy between the diversity of the major parties: 6% of Conservative MPs are Black or Minority Ethnicities, compared to 20% in the Labour party and 18% in the Lib Dems. 56.9% of the MPs from Ethnic Minority backgrounds are women as of the 2019 election, a total of 37 MPs. Only 6.3% of the House of Lords are Ethnic Minorities. Black and Minority Ethnicity representation at the local government level is far behind the national. Within the Public Sector, there are high levels of Black and Minority Ethnic staff, but “in the majority of cases where data is available, ethnic minority representation is often lower in the higher pay grades.”</p> 
          <p>Whilst there are signs of progress in the position of Black Britons in politics in statistical terms, racist attitudes are still prevalent in British society. In a 2021 YouGov Survey, ‘Unequal Britain: attitudes to inequalities aftter COVID-19’, 47% of respondents believed that black people are more likely to be unemployed due to discrimination. However, 13% of the 2000 participants claimed that these inequalities are the result of black people lacking “motivation or willpower” and 4% claim Black people have “less in-born ability to learn,” reflecting a concerning, discriminatory and baseless view. There is however, some evidence from the study that the younger generation is less racist. There is clear evidence that Black and Minority Ethnic MPs face racism within the public sphere, from the media, state infrastructure, and the public. Research by ITV has found that 62% have faced ‘racism or racial profiling’ whilst on the Parliamentary estate in London, and 51% said this  had come from fellow MPs. A year after this report it is unclear what the House of Commons is doing to address this discriminatory culture at the heart of our democracy. </p><br>

             Reni Eddo- Lodge is an anti-racism, feminist campaigner, writer and journalist. Notably Reni’s work, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, made Reni the first black author to top the UK bestseller list. Reni reached the number 1 spot in 2020 for her text which was published in 2017 and began with a blog post in 2014. The Nielsen Bookscan’s UK top 50 has been recording book sales in 2001. Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race topped the best seller list in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and the renewed awareness and participation in the Black Lives Matters movement in the summer of 2020. Reni comments on the challenges of this coupled with the fact that she is the first black author in the UK to reach this position:“Can’t help but be dismayed by this - the tragic circumstances in which this achievement came about… the fact that it’s 2020 and I’m the first.” Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race is a celebrated text, having won the Jhalak Prize for Book of the Year by a Writer of Colour in 2018, as one example. Reni is credited with promoting and articulating an intersectional approach to discrimination “into mainstream dialogue.” </p>
          <p> Reni does not identify as an activist, while she engaged in activism at the University of Central Lancashire and became president of the Student’s Union, she know reflects: “. “I think early bios from a few years ago would describe me as an activist but I’m not really, because I’m not willing to put my body on the line. I’m happy to support in other ways.” Reni also has a podcast, ‘About Race with Reni Eddo-Lodge’ in which Reni and guests discuss the history and politics of race in the UK.

            Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, who goes by Lady Phyll, is a leading LGBTQ+ activist in the UK.  Lady Phyll co-founded UK Black Pride in 2005, which is “Europe’s largest celebration for LGBTQ people of African, Asian, Caribbean, Latin American and Middle Eastern descent.” Lady Phyll remains one of the event’s trustees and executive directors. Further to this Lady Phyll was a trustee of Stonewall for three years, which is the largest LGBTQ+ rights organisation in Europe. Lady Phyll has also been an executive director of the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, Kaleidoscope Trust, since 2019. Kaleidoscope works to promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people in countries in which people face discrimination for their sexuality and gender identity. Lots of Lady Phyll’s activism and campaigning occurs in this space too. Lady Phyll is also a trade unionist, and has sat on the Trade Union Council race relations committee.</p>
            <p> Lady Phyll rejected an MBE in 2016 due to the “toxic legacy” of the British Empire. In her own words: "As a trade unionist, a working class girl, and an out black African lesbian, I want to stand by my principles and values. I don't believe in empire. I don't believe in, and actively resist, colonialism and its toxic and enduring legacy in the Commonwealth, where - among many other injustices - LGBTQI people are still being persecuted, tortured and even killed because of sodomy laws… that were put in place by British imperialists.”

             Lavinya Stennett is the founder and CEO of the Black Curriculum, a social enterprise which since 2019 has been campaigning to address the lack of Black British history on the UK curriculum. The Black Curriculum is led by young people and designs teacher training and Black history programmes targeted at ages 8-16. One of the main intentions of the programme is to “equip young people with a sense of identity”. Lavinya reflects on her experience of the British education system growing up in South London and the impact of the Eurocentricity of the history programme, including on sense of belonging and representation in history. “I know it was a problem… but the language I have now, I didn’t have then. I didn’t feel part of that classroom environment and it wasn’t engaging at all.” Further the Black Curriculum was inspired by the absence of Black British history within even the Black History Month classes as these focused on slavery and US civil rights. During her degree in African studies and Development studies at SOAS Lavinya was taught a more broad, representative and deep history programme and designed the Black Curriculum in response. At SOAS, Lavinya was the University’s first Black Student Officer and won Activist of the Year in her final year.</p>
             <p><strong>“When we look back in history, we see that Britain was a very global island and that black people have always been very present. When you don’t know that, you treat the current day as abnormal. You’re not encouraged to see diversity as a good thing. These are the things we call unconscious bias, but it’s very conscious in the curriculum. You don’t actually learn any black or African history. That is a conscious omission.”</strong></p>

In 2018 she won the Groundwork’s young community leader of the year award for her work supporting and uplifting her community in Barnet. Notably she is the founder and executive director of the 4Front Project, established in 2012. 4Front is a youth led social enterprise that empowers communities and young people to live free from violence. “We support members with experiences of violence and the criminal justice system to create change; in their own lives, communities and society.” The 4Front projects model centres healing over punishment in response to violence, to build peace and justice, and understands that the experience of racial inequality, and the flaws of the criminal justice system in the UK, exacerbate violence. 4Front provides long term support and empowerment services for people aged 11-25 in prison, schools and communities to achieve this.  Temi also uses her platform to dispel commonly held views about gang crime and hold the government and local authority to account on their response to this crisis, and failure to address the underlying roots: “when does the government take responsibility for the forms of violence that they inflict on others?” </p>
