          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of black womens contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britian.</h3>
        <p>This project is led by three Leeds Uni history students keen to promote the contributions of black women to British history and particularly the pursuit of social change. 
          We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglecting area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of black women's contributions even more critical. Unfortunately, given the neglect of this history there are limited sources available about many pioneering black women. This presented even more of a challenge to our project given we completed it during C19 and couldn't access in person archives. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create an inaccurate and reductive picture. 
          Basically we intend to show the breadth of black British women's active contribution to change in the country. We hope to illuminate through the time period covered that this is not a new phenomenon. The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. The foundations of our society are largely seen in this period and this is emphasised through our education system. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how black women contributed to the breadth of this period. 
          While there is an increasing visibility of black women in the British political and campaigning sphere, our research shows that this is still insufficient in public consciousness.</p>
