          <h3>This website exists to highlight the long history of Black women's contribution to politics, campaigning and political change in Britain.</h3>
        <p>We selected this project focus as, through our continued study of history into higher education, and personal extracurricular interests, we are able to reflect that this is a depressingly neglected area of attention in the education system and social consciousness of the majority in the UK. 
          We do not wish to overlook the contribution of all Black people to social and political change in the UK but needed to limit our focus in order to enable us to produce a coherent and accessible project, and give ourselves a manageable workload!
          We also recognise that there is an intersection in the standards that women and people of colour are held to in the political sphere and the prejudice they face, making the recognition of Black women's contributions even more critical. <strong> This is by no means an exhaustive list of brilliant Black women in the British political sphere</strong> but we hope we have elevated the story of some overlooked Black women in this project.</p>
        <p>We intentionally did not restrict our time frame for a number of reasons. In our research we found that Black women have been contributing to politics and community activism in the UK for centuries, and in awareness of the collective amnesia concerning this that our education system creates, we did not want to be complicit in this and create a reductive picture. 
          The 18th- 21st centuries are a well documented period of British history, in which significant political, social and economic change occured. We therefore want to mirror this historiographical trend and identify how Black women contributed to the breadth of this period.

          </a> Born in West Africa (Senegal or Gambia), Phillis was captured and enslaved when she was seven and purchased by the Wheatleys, a wealthy American family. The Wheatleys taught her to read and write and she soon developed a passion for poetry, being published at the age of just thirteen. By the time she had turned 18 she had amassed a collection of 28 poems and her writing had become popular in both America and Britain.

               </a> The Wheatleys moved to London in search of a publisher, and she was welcomed by prominent abolitionists who saw her as crucial to their cause. Wheatley’s poetry was used to undermine the institution of slavery and to humanise Africans. Her art was a driving force for changing public opinions on slavery.

         <div><h4><a href="/sources_page.html#Mary"><strong>Mary Prince (1788-?) </strong></a></h4>
           <p>Prince was born into slavery in Bermuda and sold to various brutal slaveowners. Prince was sold for a fourth time to John Adam Woods and worked as a domestic slave in his Antiguan residence. There she joined the Moravian church and learnt to read. In 1826, Prince married without the permission of the Woods, much to their anger. The Woods travelled to England with Prince, separating her from her husband. It was illegal to transport slaves out of England, meaning Prince had some safety. This however meant she could not return to her husband in Antigua (for fear of re-enslavement) unless the Woods granted her emancipation, which they refused. 
             </p>            
         <p>Prince fought against the Woods and presented a petition to Parliament demanding her freedom, making Prince the first woman ever to submit a petition to Parliament. She began to work alongside abolitionist writer Thomas Pringle and produced her autobiography, ‘The History of Mary Prince’. Her writing marked a crucial advancement in the abolitionist cause and shone light on the abhorrent practise of slavery.

        <h2 id="1800s">1800s</h2>
          <p>This period was marked by worldwide sweeping changes. The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw abolitionism rise to success with slavery being abolished in Britain in 1833. The fight against slavery transitioned into activism to protect and further the lives of Black British people. The Black female activists in this period risked their safety in a racist and sexist society to fight for justice and their tireless work is still felt to this day.</p>

             </a> Born in Jamaica Mary Seacole took an interest in medicine and healing from a young age, working in a boarding house for sick and injured soldiers at just 12 years old. 
Upon hearing of the dire conditions soldiers in Crimea were facing and the inadequate medical infrastructures in place there, Mary travelled to London and asked the British War Office to send her to Crimea to help. Mary was refused because she was Black. Undeterred, she raised her own funds to travel to Crimea, and established the ‘British Hotel’ to house and care for injured officers.

               </a>While Florence Nightingale’s hospital was hundreds of miles from the front line, Mary’s was far closer to the action. She even tended to the wounded on the frontline while under direct fire.
Seacole gained much support and praise but was eventually whitewashed out of history. After almost a century of being lost, activists campaigned tirelessly to bring Seacole into the mainstream. In 2004 she was voted the greatest Black Briton in history and, after a 12-year campaign, a statue to commemorate her was unveiled in 2016 by Baroness Benjamin.

             </a> Ellen Craft was a prominent abolitionist born and enslaved in Macon, Georgia. She escaped slavery by disguising herself as a white male and presented her husband as her personal slave. Although she was successful the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 pushed the Crafts to leave America and find safety in England. 
Ellen turned their Hammersmith home into a hub of Black activism and often housed fellow Black abolitionists. She became a member of many reform and suffrage organisations such as the London Emancipation Committee and the British and Foreign Freedman’s Society. 
          </p>            
         <p><Ellen gave many lectures about her enslavement and together with her husband published a book on their experience, <em>‘Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom’</em>. Through her activism and writing Ellen craft helped further both the American and British abolitionist causes. Her genius and dangerous escape is testament to her steadfast bravery in the face of white supremacy.

               </a>Born in South Africa, Kinloch came to Britain in the late 1890s. An avid activist in the fight against colonialism and imperialism in Africa, Kinloch co-founded the African Association. The association worked to educate and mobilise the masses against the institution of colonialism and was trailblazing in giving a voice to the Black British community. The association went on to assemble the first Pan-African conference in 1900. Kinloch has been written out of mainstream British history: no results are shown for her when looking in the Leeds University Library, the British Library, Google Scholar or JSTOR and yet she was a key figure in the Pan-African movement. Her actions and activism were crucial in giving a voice to and elevating the African diaspora. Her strength and perseverance in the face of racism and sexism should never be forgotten.

          </a> Gerlin Bean came to London from Jamaica in 1960. In 1970, she attended the National Women’s Liberation conference in Oxford and was motivated to create a space in women’s liberation for Black women.

              </a>In August 1970, Jones-Lecointe held a protest outside the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, speaking out against ‘state neglect, self-help and the rights of British citizens’ (Johnson). After violence broke out, nine Black activists, including Jones-Lecointe, were arrested. During the trial, Jones-Lecointe represented herself, and assisted in exposing racism within the Metropolitan Police force. The trial was a hugely significant moment for Black British history and demonstrated a successful legal battle between Black British people and the judicial system.

               </a> Frances Ezzrecco has often been neglected in the history of Black British radicalism.

In 1961, Ezzrecco was a key organiser in the Afro-Asian-Caribbean Conference (AACC). Ezzrecco was clearly a dedicated and proficient political organiser, but she has not been researched as an activist in her own right.

          </a>Dawn Butler is a senior Labour party MP who grew up in East London with her Jamaican parents. Dawn was elected MP for Brent South in 2005 and became only the third Black woman elected to the House of Commons. Since Dawn has been the first elected Black woman to sit in the British Cabinet (Minister of State for Youth Affairs in 2009) and the first Black woman to speak from the dispatch box in December 2009: “the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history… they’d all been instructed to put me down.”

            Lavinya Stennett is the founder and CEO of the Black Curriculum, a social enterprise founded in 2019. The Black Curriculum is led by young people and designs teacher training and Black history programmes targeted at ages 8-16. The Black Curriculum was inspired by the absence of Black British history within even the Black History Month classes during Lavinya’s upbringing in South London; these focused on slavery and US civil rights.

          <p>In the 21st century there is far greater representation of Black Britons in the political mainstream. However, racism directed at Black people in the political sphere persists and representation in the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the top levels of public bodies is far below what would be proportional to the population of the UK.</p>
          <p>Since 1987 there has been an increase in Black and Minority Ethnicity MPs elected in the UK at every election, with 65 elected in 2019. This is 10% of our parliament, which is not proportional to the 14.4% of our electorate that is Black or Minority Ethnic. Further, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/kzi666gg1s/KCL_Inequality1stRelease_201113.pdf">2021 YouGov Survey, ‘Unequal Britain: attitudes to inequalities after COVID-19’</a> demonstrates that a concerning level of racism remains in our society, and research conducted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/black-minority-ethnic-mps-racism-in-parliament-study">ITV in 2020</a> found that <strong>over 50% of Black and Minority Ethnicity MPs had experienced racial discrimination by another sitting member of parliament</strong>. There is a long way to go.</p>
